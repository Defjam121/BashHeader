BashHeader
==========

This is the Bash file setup I use to start my scripts. 

I tend to follow the Google shell scripting style guide here: 
https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml

I hope that this set-up may help others keep their shell scripts neat,
readable, and organized.
